            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

If there were no <hi>Breakers</hi> to circumvent, the <hi>Merchants</hi> needed no policie to prevent; which would in time inure them to ſecuritie, and make them ignorant in the cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of preventing policie. Yea, But it is objected, that theſe <hi>Bankrupt Merchants</hi> are profeſt enemies to all civill Commerce; Admit this were ſo, yet in ſome Caſes it is as neceſſarie to have enemies as friends. <hi>Naſica,</hi> when the Roman Common-weal was ſuppoſed to bee in moſt ſecure eſtate, becauſe free of their enemies, affirmed; That though the <hi>Achaians</hi> and <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were both brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the yoke of bondage, yet they were in moſt danger, becauſe none were left whom they might eyther feare for danger, or who ſhould keepe them in awe. The like courſe obſerved <hi>Oenomademus,</hi> in the Ile of <hi>Chios,</hi> when hee counſelled his fellowes, That they ſhould not expell all their enemies, but ſtill leave ſome in the City; leſt (quoth hee) being void of all our enemies, we ſhould begin to quarrel with our friends: Beſides, if our wealthy Traders ſhould not ſomtimes encounter with theſe rubs, their much proſperity would make them inſolent, ſo as labouring with their owne burden, they would
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:48206:30"/> become profuſe Rioters in the ſmooth progreſſe of their fortunes, ſo as I may properly retort the laſt Speakers words upon himſelfe, and confidently affi me, That theſe <hi>Decayed Merchants</hi> are excellent <hi>Phlebotomiſts</hi> to purge the ful bodies of ſuch Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who by continuance of Commerce are grown to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

                  <p>Excuſe me now (my ancient and familiar friends) in that I have longer inſiſted upon the verball repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of all materiall points and branches of this Statute; for I am not ignorant how much the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view and peruſall thereof concerns you; but fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing leſt the length hereof might beget in you a kind of wearineſſe (having your heads at this time work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about affayres of high conſequence) I have here

Firſt, all ſuch Laws and Statutes as were heretofore made againſt Bankrupts, and for reliefe of Creditors, are for the better reliefe and redreſſe of the ſaid Creditors, largely and beneficially conſtrued and expounded. Secondly, the qualitie, nature and condition of a Bankrupt is in his colours lively deſcribed, diſplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and diſcovered. Thirdly, the like Commiſſions, Orders, Benefits and Remedies which are, and bee provided &amp; limited by the ſaid former Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament made 13 <hi>Eliz.</hi> and 1 <hi>Jac.</hi> againſt any Bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts, ſhall bee proſecuted and expounded againſt ſuch Bankrupts, as by their eſpeciall, perſonall marks are herein declared or expreſſed. Fourthly, the ſame orders, benefits and remedies which are by this preſent Act provided and limited againſt any Bankrupt, ſhall henceforth be purſued &amp; expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt ſuch perſon and perſons as by the ſaid former Acts of Parliaments are declared or expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to bee Bankrupts. Fiftly, the Commiſſioners power is illuſtrated; a doubt, touching examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Bankrupts wives cleered, and the penalties whereto refractory women are incident, in caſes of denying or refuſing to be examined fully expreſſed. Sixtly, what publick puniſhment ſhall be on ſuch men or women inflicted, as upon examination ſhall be either found to have concealed the truth, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed ſuch eſtates as were theirs, or to them upon
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:48206:36"/> truſt recommended. Seventhly, the Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners authority is inlarged, and to the breaking open of the Bankrupts houſe, warehouſe, chamber, ſhop, cheſt or trunck authorized. Eighthly, there is a courſe propoſed, how diviſion and diſtribution of the Bankrupts Lands and Goods, to the reliefe of the Creditor ſhall be diſpoſed, and how to every one a ratable part is to be apportioned. Ninthly, if any Lands, Tenements, Goods, Chattels, Debts, or other eſtate of any Bankrupt chance to be exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded under colour or pretence of being accomptant or any way indebted to our Soveraigne Lord, his heirs or ſucceſſors; the ſaid Commiſſioners are to examine upon Oath, whether the ſaid Debt were due to the ſaid debtor or accomptant: And if ſuch bargaine or contract was originally made, the ſaid Commiſſioners are to order and diſpoſe of all ſuch Lands, &amp;c. ſo extended, to the ſole uſe of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors, who ſeeke reliefe by the ſaid Commiſſion, and to whoſe behoofe they are to bee converted.

                        <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Olymorphus Simianus</hi> a <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> born, a younger brother, but well deſcended; and during his minority, in all generous &amp; free-born Studies trained. He was naturally affected to Poeſie; from the delight whereof his Father, being of eminent eſteeme in <hi>Florence,</hi> la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to waine him; by diverting his courſe that way, and importuning him to the ſtudy of the Law. Whereto having for ſome yeares applyed his minde, he grew in ſhort time indifferently furniſhed. Neither was his pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe leſſe uſefull then his knowledge fruitfull. Albeit inwardly he could never reliſh nor palat that profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; being, as he termed it, a <hi>practiſe</hi> whoſe <hi>materiall</hi> were <hi>extracted</hi> from <hi>extortion:</hi> yet to give all poſſible content to his father, he ever extended his beſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, ſeemingly to further what he could not favour. Being now growne a pretty good proficient in a profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:48206:145"/> contrary to his element; you ſhall heare upon what occaſion he became degraded, from the benefit of his practiſe excluded, and by a judicial, though incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible cenſure, ſilenced. Pleading one day with great ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemencie for his friend <hi>Farneſio,</hi> a Citizen of appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved honeſty, and whoſe cauſe deſerved no leſſe ſucceſſe; being in the judgement of the whole Court, grounded on equity and uprightneſſe: He perceived the <hi>Judge</hi> of the Court to be more indulgent to the Advers part; ſo as the more he preſſed it, the more did the <hi>Judge</hi> ſl ight and diſvalue it. Wherefore being without expectance of reliefe for his much injured friend, as one eyther tranſported with <hi>paſſion,</hi> to ſee <hi>corruption</hi> ſeated on the throne of <hi>Judgement;</hi> or tranſpierced with <hi>affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> to ſee his honeſt friend ſo high<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

My Lord,</hi> quoth he, <hi>my comfort is, though this gentleman my clyent, be by your Lordſhip inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly cenſured, the date of your commiſſion for ſitting on Judgement is almoſt expired; ſo as our hope is, by your Succeſſour we ſhall be redreſſed. Expired (ſaid the Judge) how doe you meane? I meane (replied</hi> Simianus) <hi>you are at the point of death. Your reaſon, (quoth the</hi> Judge) <hi>for I feele no ſuch matter in my ſelfe. The more dangerous is your malady (anſwered</hi> Simianus;) <hi>for diſeaſes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible are ever held moſt incurable; but to reſolve your doubt with an infallible reaſon; your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip knowes it is an ancient ſacred ceremony here in</hi> Florence, <hi>as in all other Catholique Countries, for
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:48206:145"/> the ſick immediatly before the approching in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant of their diſſolution, to receive from a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man thereto ordained and conſecrated,</hi> extreme unction. The <hi>Judge</hi> perceiving whereto his meaning tended, covertly implying <hi>corruption</hi> by thoſe words of <hi>extreme unction,</hi> with preſent paſſion tranſported, commanded him forthwith to depart the Court, in theſe words. <hi>Sir: for your ſmall reverence to this place, heare your cenſure. So long as the State of</hi> Florence <hi>ſhall authorize me to ſit in this Seat of judgement, I injoyne you Silence, to caution others by your example to ſhew more reverence.</hi> No ſooner was this heavie Cenſure pronounced, then <hi>Simianus</hi> left the Court; allthough he had many friendly Orators, who with their beſt perſwaſive Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick laboured to mitigate the <hi>Judges</hi> cenſure; whom they found ſteeled with relentleſſe rigour. About this time when <hi>Simianus</hi> was ſilenced, his father died; by whoſe death he was more troubled, then with his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſentence diſquieted: for of ſuch generall eſteeme (as I formerly noted) was this <hi>old man,</hi> as he was no leſſe for his wiſedome and judgement approved, then for his diſcreete carriage and amiable converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on generally loved: ſo as his vertues gain'd his progeny much honour in <hi>Florence.
